Game Jam: One Game A Month - FLAGS

[Download full game](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2bk8at29al5cmhb/DwarfClimber.zip)


In this 2d side scroller, you are a dwarf with a flag. Collect coins and carry the flag to the top of the mountain! (What else would you do in a side scroller?) If you die, the flag will mark your grave. Don't worry, you'll get another flag!

This project is our first [One Game a Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) game and our first time using Unreal Engine 4.
